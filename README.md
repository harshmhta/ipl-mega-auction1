This uses the Material Dashboard UI and Framework from Creative Tim.

Material Dashboard is a free Material Bootstrap Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. We are very excited to introduce our take on the material concepts through an easy to use and beautiful set of components. Material Dashboard was built over the popular Bootstrap framework and it comes with a couple of third-party plugins redesigned to fit in with the rest of the element

I would like to credit Creative Tim for the website UI and framework.

Some unique functionalities were achieved by custom coding, such as:
- Login/Sign up
- Adding a player for the auction
- Selecting a player from the auction for the team
- Bidding a player
- Calculating total money spent by a team
- Finding the most expensive player
- Adding fixtures for the Blasters Premier League
- Recording the results of the matches that took place

This is an ongoing project, therefore, there will be new implementations.
